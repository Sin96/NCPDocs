Somewhat digested version of a changes history.

This section is probably not complete ever, but it can give a quick overview what parts to adapt or regenerate. The builds marked with //(**mostly stable**)// Are considered very stable and should be preferred over all previous dev/beta builds.

The //(cumulative)// note is meant to indicate that that build should be preferred over the lower numbers since the last entry.

Broken builds usually are marked as broken or removed from Jenkins, they should not appear in this list.

----
===Future===
====Planned (at distance)====
Pretty hard targets, but too far off the schedule to give any ETA.
* Full core-recode. API-independent core + on-the-fly adding and removal of checks and other.
* Better mod support for arbitrary blocks and tools. Includes cleanup of block-properties-handling.
* Ingame configuration management (convenience, comparison, suggestions, hot-fixes).
* Allow making doors safe (e.g. enable ray-tracing by keeping track of redstone changes).
* Keep track of pistons moving blocks in order to reduce false positives.
* Add check/notification for players not using any velocity (mostly sf), at least start to log it for testing.
* Velocity handling: Add concept to merge / invalidate queued entries better (flying plugins).
* Velocity handling: Switch to 3d-entries with "exact" per-axis/direction counting.
* Moving/morepackets: Further invalidate past intervals to be more precise. Maybe include latency estimates.
====Planned (soon-ish)====
Big topics, short- to medium-term.
* Moving/morepackets+survialfly: Attempt to prevent speeding better, probably relate packets and travel-distance.
* SurvivalFly: More adjustments based on so-far-experience (e.g. buffer redesign, ground modifiers).
* Concentrate data and configs in DataManager (+WorldData + WorldConfig?) and PlayerData.
====Scheduled (fixed)====
Topics that are in focus right now.
* //NCPDocs overhaul (does not concern the plugin).//
* //"Full" UUID compatibility//.
* Fight checks refinement.
** Direction + Reach: implement refined methods.
** Speed (and maybe other frequency-related checks): New skipping mechanisms (e.g. probability).
* On-the-fly debug trace
** Allow tracing any player at any moment with commands (asynchronous logging, extra files).
** Allow triggering temporary debug traces automatically, e.g. if players are moving into/inside blocks.
* Packet level checks and PlayerData
** Tab-complete: Prevent spamming. Might allow to disable '/', all commands, all.
** Add a config for the net checks for efficient access.
** Might integrate config or individual data into PlayerData and config/s into DataManager right away.
* Logging (some might get postponed)
** Add TestNCP core functionality to NCP (log all violations to trace file + ingame, if configured so).
** Allow ingame also to be asynchronous (In-game remains problematic, still consider relaying to a primary thread task).
** Allow to store past logs, e.g. with every restart of the plugin or even reload (!)..
** Might provide a command to directly log to a log target (use with actions or as admin for reference).
** Option to log all commands that are executed.
** Rolling files, split by size or timing. Backup option (move).
** On the fly debug logging.
*** Start tracing automatically (e.g. a selection of criteria based on what we can't detect directly).
*** Post-violation trace: Write debug information when a violation happens (e.g. recorded moves).
*** Many more possibilities...
===Milestones now in focus===
* Release for MC 1.8 [3.12.x ... likely split into two or three]
** Planned:
*** Basic repair of fight checks.
*** Provide NCP over a maven repository.
*** Various fixes.
** Should bring in long waiting points:
*** Attribute support: speed.
** Might postpone complex to mend issues:
*** Slime block + pistons (means: pistons in general).

** Fix moving events while in vehicles. 
* Internals
** Treat respawn mostly like join. Both the hover and enforcelocation features could now kick in. [Unresolved: Some worlds have the spawn location set underground, but spawn the players above - currently this is conflicting, you should use a simple plugin to set the world spawn manually in such a case.]

Currently only the latest location and those that arrived in the same tick are counted in, also the checking logics is the same as before, for the sake of finding bugs without altering too much at once.
* Fixes
** NoFall: Ignore players in vehicles when they take fall-damage. Aims at issues with horses.
** NoFall: Potential fix for issues with players that are allowed to fly or in creative mode on logout.

* New features
** Ctrl+sprint: Add a workaround option to let NCP assume a player is sprinting, whenever possible (checks.moving.assumesprint).
** Changing the tool now leads to a configurable attack penalty (checks.fight.toolchangepenalty).
** Changing the tool now resets the block-break timing.
** blockplace.against is a "full check" now - previously without history entries and without configuration.

** checks.fight.direction is now set to false by default.
** Increased the default kick-level for the moving.survivalfly actions to 1500.
** checks.moving.passable.raytracing.vcliponly is now set to false. This means much more checking but prevents moving through walls exactly horizontally by default.

* New
** New shortcut permissions.
** Command "ncp inspect (player)": info about health, walkspeed and similar.
* Configuration changes
** opinconsoleonly: Add a commands list for more general use, put into protection.commands.consoleonly section.
** All command lists in the configuration can be set up without using the prefix "/".

** SurvivalFly: Attempt to catch "glide" with vertical accounting [Could cause new false positives, NEED FEEDBACK].
** SurvivalFly: The workaround for sprint/bunny while attacking others is modeled differently, which should now work with sprint effects.
** SurvivalFly: Prevent negative horizontal buffer.
** CreativeFly: Jump amplifier gets reset properly now.
** Waterwalk: Fix waterwalk triggering for walking into water on some occasions.
** Worked around in earlier builds: carpets.
* API extensions:
** Configuration handling: Action factories are set up lazily now in order to allow better overriding by other plugins. Effect could be that once per reload some events get a higher processing time (only the first getting of the config).
** INotifyReload can be registered with a priority set in an annotation, thus you can ensure your reload hook gets called before any NCP-internal hooks.
** LogAction: Constructor used for optimized action is now on protected visibility instead of private.
* Internals
** SurvivalFly: Cleanups: Move some code into methods, alter checking order in some places, comments, other.
** SurvivalFly: Revert allowing to consume buffers and velocity for sprintback, change extra buffer to counter for the "lost sprint" problem.

** SurvivalFly: Perform less double checking (perm checks) by testing bunny first, and a second time afterwards only if necessary.
** SurvivalFly: Bunny-hop: Also applies when not sprinting, also with not jumping. (Working towards confining/removing the buffer.)
===3.10.1-SNAPSHOT-b587(cumulative)===
* Hot
** Account for per-player walk-speed and fly-speed.

** Cleanups (vehicle handling, comments, javadocs).
===3.10.1-SNAPSHOT-b580(cumulative)===
* Changes:
** Configuration version: Now has its own section in the configuration, notification can be disabled.
** Configuration outdated warnings and notify-off message are sent delayed, not from within PlayerJoinEvent-handling.
** Health-API incompatibility warnings: Only show if logging.debug is set.
* Fixes
** Passable: Fence gates, moving out of blocks if stuck (tp, login), creativefly ignoring passable set-back, vcliponly covers up and down now.
** SurvivalFly: Web + stairs/steps.
* Internals
** Moving debug output will contain walkspeed + flyspeed (future use).
** Passable: Potentially improve performance by an earlier return for moves that are fully inside of ignored blocks.
** More cleanup for health-API changes.
** Event priorities for some core setup changed (world change + player join set to low), affects mod message sending.
** Added global message-sending queue preserving registration-order (currently thread-safe). Used for delayed sending of notification messages and warnings for chat.txt.

** Just in case: To keep the morepackets-vehicle check effective, auto-detection of vehicle events has been added. [Should work, missing: use new events for mount/dismount etc.]
** Just in case: Force close inventories on portal use and world changes, also taking into account riding on entities (on entities...).
* Fixes
** Workarounds added for potential problems with other plugins that don't implement certain compatibility tweaks for the changes in Bukkit from MC 1.5.2 to 1.6.1.

* Consistency fixes and extensions (fixes some chat checks data not resetting with the remove command).
----
===3.9.0-RC-b488(**release**)===
* Release on BukkitDev.
===3.9.0-b486(cumulative)===
* MC 1.5.1 and 1.5.0 support (blocks + obc/nms-access).\\//This allows players to move into corners of fence-setups also for earlier Minecraft versions.//
* Add basic thorns support (workaround for missing API).
* Fixes for fastbreak with wood-pick + efficiency.
* Might have given jumping on boats slightly more tolerance.
* Consistency fixes (block setup, prevent CB2511 module loading for libigot/no-safeguard-mods).
----
===3.8.12-RC2-b472(**release**)===
* Release on BukkitDev. [Last minute fixes might follow.]
* Catch on case for ArrayIndexOutOfBounds with InventoryClickEvent.
===3.8.12-RC-b471(planned release)===
* Planned release.
===3.8.12-b470(cumulative)===
* Re-code inventory.fastclick. Likely it is more forgiving on first glance and we might need to add specialized tool/weapon/food checks later, however it allows better control over limits, rudimentary support for some 1.5 inventory issues/features.
* Fix passable ray-tracing not respecting the block-flags.
* Add an example entry for overriding block-flags (doing nothing). Snow levels might not work on 1.4.7 servers with hackish 1.5-protocol support, which can be part-fixed by setting the flags for snow to ground+solid+height_8_inc.
